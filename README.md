## Ingest Results

The code in this directory creates placeholders / examples of ground
truth and submissions.  It is useful to see what a submission should
look like and allows us to practice ingesting the data for scoring and
visualizations.  The ground truth information, like the submission
data, is made up.

## Masks

The code in this directory makes the mask information for training
data consistent.
