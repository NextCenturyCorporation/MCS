                <p>The link below will take you to a dashboard that will allow you to
                filter and select individual tests from the blocks.  NOTE: the data in
                the dashboard at present is completely made up. </p>
                <p>You can click on any of the bar graphs to select a particular
                sub-set of the test data.  For example, to only see results from Block
                O1, click on that bar in the Blocks area on the upper right.  When you
                select a particular performer, submission, or block, the Ground Truth
                vs Plausibility graph will change, showing only that data.</p>
                <p>The tests in IntPhys are internally divided into different
                categories, depending on their level of dynamic complexity, the number
                of objects, and whether there is an occluder present.  You can also
                filter on these; for example, you can compare the results when there
                are different numbers of objects present.
                <p>The Ground Truth vs Plausibility graph in the middle shows the
                ground truth (either 0 for implausible or 1 for plausible) versus the
                submitted answer (a float value between 0 and 1).  A perfect score
                would be to have all the results at the bottom right (0,0) or upper
                left (1,1).  The graph is also selectable, so it may be of interest to
                see why various tests are returning a low value    when ground truth is
                1. <p>

                <p>The data table on the bottom of the page will allow a user to select a
                particular test.  THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.  Click on the row and
                it will take you to another page that shows the results for a
                partiular test.</p>
