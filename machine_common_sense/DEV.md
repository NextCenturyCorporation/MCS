# MCS Package Developer

## Package Installation

### Create a Virtual Environment

```
$ python3.6 -m venv --prompt mcs venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(mcs) $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### Install the MCS Package and dependencies

Install the packages included in the requirements file so that linting and documentation work. The requirements.txt file includes developer and package dependencies.

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

From the MCS root folder, install the package in your virtual environment in editable mode (-e) so that local changes will automatically reflect in the virtual environment.

```
python -m pip install -e .
```

### Run pre-commit

Run pre-commit install to set up the git hooks for linting and auto-documentation.

```
pre-commit install
```

## Linting

We are currently using [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) for linting and formatting our Python code. This is enforced within the python_api and scene_generator projects. Both are [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant (besides some inline exceptions), although we are ignoring the following rules:
- **E402**: Module level import not at top of file
- **W504**: Line break occurred after a binary operator

A full list of error codes and warnings enforced can be found [here](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html)

Both have settings so that they should run on save within Visual Studio Code [settings.json](.vscode/settings.json) as well as on commit after running `pre-commit install` (see [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml) and [.flake8](.flake8)), but can also be run on the command line:


```
flake8
```

and

```
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --recursive <directory>
```
or
```
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive <file>
```

## Python Style Guide

See https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html

## Running

We have made multiple run scripts:

To run a script (like `run_human_input.py`) from the terminal with visual output:

```
run_in_human_input_mode <mcs_unity_build_file> <mcs_config_json_file>
```

To run it headlessly, first install xvfb (on Ubuntu, run `sudo apt-get install xvfb`), then:

```
xvfb-run --auto-servernum --server-args='-screen 0 640x480x24' python3 run_human_input.py <mcs_unity_build_file> <mcs_config_json_file>
```

Each run will generate a subdirectory (named based on your config file) containing the output image files from each step.

## Making GIFs

First, install ffmpeg. Then (change the frame rate with the `-r` option):

```
ffmpeg -r 3 -i frame_image_%d.png output.gif
```

## Full List of Config Options

Outlined here is a comprehensive list of config file options that can be used.

To use an MCS configuration file, you can either pass in a file path via the `config_file_path` property in the create_controller() method, or set the `MCS_CONFIG_FILE_PATH` environment variable to the path of your MCS configuration file (note that the configuration must be an INI file -- see [sample_config.ini](../sample_config.ini) for an example).

### Config File Properties

#### AWS specific properties

The following string properties can be specified in order to upload and organize files in S3:
- aws_access_key_id
- aws_secret_access_key
- s3_bucket
- s3_folder

#### debug

(boolean)

Whether to save MCS output debug files in this folder. Will default to `False`. In lieu of a config file, this can be set using the `MCS_DEBUG_MODE` environment variable.

#### debug_output

(string)

Alternatively to the `debug` property, `debug_output` can be used to either print debug info to the terminal or to debug files only. This should either be set to `file` or `terminal`, and will default to None. Will be ignored if `debug` or `MCS_DEBUG_MODE` is set.

#### evaluation

(boolean)

Whether or not we're running in evaluation mode (default: False). If `True`, evaluation files for each scene will be created and uploaded to S3.

#### evaluation_name

(string)

Identifier to add to filenames uploaded to S3 (default: '').

#### metadata

(string)

The `metadata` property describes what metadata will be returned by the MCS Python library. This can also be specified via the `MCS_METADATA_LEVEL` environment variable. It can be set to one of the following strings:

- `oracle`: Returns the metadata for all the objects in the scene, including visible, held, and hidden objects. Object masks will have consistent colors throughout all steps for a scene.
- `level2`: Only returns the images (with depth masks AND object masks), camera info, and properties corresponding to the player themself (like head tilt or pose). No information about specific objects will be included. Note that here, object masks will have randomized colors per step.
- `level1`: Only returns the images (with depth masks but NOT object masks), camera info, and properties corresponding to the player themself (like head tilt or pose). No information about specific objects will be included.
- `none`: Only returns the images (but not the masks), camera info, and properties corresponding to the player themself (like head tilt or pose). No information about specific objects will be included.

Otherwise, return the metadata for the visible and held objects.

#### noise_enabled

(boolean)

Whether to add random noise to the numerical amounts in movement and object interaction action parameters. Will default to `False`.

# seed

(int)

A seed for the Python random number generator (defaults to None).

#### size

(int)

Desired screen width. If value given, it must be more than `450`. If none given, screen width will default to `600`.

#### team

(string)

Team name identifier to prefix to filenames uploaded to S3 (default: '').
