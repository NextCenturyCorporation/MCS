    Interact with an agent. If that agent has an object, it will hold
    out the object for you to pickup; otherwise, the agent will look sad.
    If the agent was pointing at an object, the agent will resume pointing
    afterward.

    Parameters
    ----------
    objectId : string, optional
        The "uuid" of the target object. Required unless the
        "objectImageCoords" properties are given.
    objectImageCoordsX : float, optional
        The X of a pixel coordinate on the target object based on
        your current viewport. Can be used in place of the "objectId" property.
        (See note under "Action" header regarding image coordinates.)
    objectImageCoordsY : float, optional
        The Y of a pixel coordinate on the target object based on
        your current viewport. Can be used in place of the "objectId" property.
        (See note under "Action" header regarding image coordinates.)

    Returns
    -------
    "SUCCESSFUL"
        Action successful.
    "NOT_INTERACTABLE"
        If the object corresponding to the "objectImageCoords" vector is not an
        interactable object.
    "NOT_OBJECT"
        If the object corresponding to the "objectId" (or object corresponding
        to the "objectImageCoords" vector) is not an object.
    "NOT_AGENT"
        If the object being interacted with is not a simulation agent
    "AGENT_CURRENTLY_INTERACTING_WTIH_PERFORMER"
        If the object being interacted with is a simulation agent already
        interacting with the performer.
    "AGENT_IS_BUSY"
        If the object being interacted with is a simulation agent that is
        currently rotating to face an object or beginning its point animation.
    "NOT_VISIBLE"
        If the object corresponding to the "objectId" is not in the viewport.
    "OUT_OF_REACH"
        If you cannot move the object because you are out of reach.
