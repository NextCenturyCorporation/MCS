- `large`: near the size of an adult
- `huge`: near the size of a sofa

Weights:

- `light`: can be held by a baby
- `heavy`: cannot be held by a baby, but can be pushed or pulled
- `massive`: cannot be moved by a baby

Colors:

- `black`
- `blue`
- `brown`
- `green`
- `grey`
- `orange`

## Goal Metadata

A goal's `metadata` property is a dict with one or more properties depending on the goal's `category` property.

Categories:

- [`"INTPHYS"`](#intphys)
- [`"RETRIEVAL"`](#retrieval)
- [`"TRANSFERRAL"`](#transferral)
- [`"TRAVERSAL"`](#traversal)

### IntPhys

In a scenario that has an IntPhys goal, you must sit and observe a scene as objects move across your camera's viewport, and then decide whether the scene is "plausible" or "implausible". These scenarios will demand a "common sense" understanding of basic ("intuitive") physics. Based on Emmanuel Dupoux's [IntPhys: A Benchmark for Visual Intuitive Physics Reasoning](https://intphys.com/).

An IntPhys goal's `metadata` (with `category` of `"INTPHYS"`) will also have the following properties:

#### choose : list of strings

The list of choices, one of which must be given in your call to `end_scene`.  For IntPhys goals, this value will always be `["plausible", "implausible"]`.

### Retrieval

In a scenario that has a retrieval goal, you must find and pickup a target object. This may involve exploring the scene, avoiding obstacles, interacting with objects (like closed containers), and (future evaluations) tracking moving objects. These scenarios will demand a "common sense" understanding of self navigation (how to move and rotate yourself within a scene and around obstacles), object interaction (how objects work, including opening containers), and (future evaluations) the basic physics of movement (kinematics, gravity, friction, etc.).

A retrieval goal's `metadata` (with `category` of `"RETRIEVAL"`) will also have the following properties:

#### target.id : string

The `objectId` of the target object to retrieve.

#### target.image : list of lists of lists of integers

An image of the target object to retrieve, given as a three-dimensional RGB pixel array.

#### target.info : list of strings

Human-readable information describing the target object needed for the visualization interface.

#### target.match_image : string

Whether the image of the target object (`target.image`) exactly matches the actual target object in the scene. If `false`, then the actual object will be different in one way (for example, the image may depict a blue ball, but the actual object is a yellow ball, or a blue cube).

### Transferral

In a scenario that has a transferral goal, you must find and pickup the first target object and put it down either next to or on top of the second target object. This may involve exploring the scene, avoiding obstacles, interacting with objects (like closed receptacles), and (future evaluations) tracking moving objects. These scenarios will demand a "common sense" understanding of self navigation (how to move and rotate yourself within a scene and around obstacles), object interaction (how objects work, including opening containers), and (future evaluations) the basic physics of movement (kinematics, gravity, friction, etc.).

A transferral goal's `metadata` (with `category` of `"TRANSFERRAL"`) will also have the following properties:

#### relationship : list of strings

The required final position of the two target objects in relation to one another.  For transferral goals, this value will always be either `["target_1", "next_to", "target_2"]` or `["target_1", "on_top_of", "target_2"]`.

#### target_1.id : string

The `objectId` of the first target object to pickup and transfer to the second target object.

#### target_1.image : list of lists of lists of integers

An image of the first target object to pickup and transfer to the second target object, given as a three-dimensional RGB pixel array.

#### target_1.info : list of strings

Human-readable information describing the target object needed for the visualization interface.

#### target_1.match_image : string

Whether the image of the first target object (`target_1.image`) exactly matches the actual object in the scene. If `false`, then the actual first target object will be different in one way (for example, the image may depict a blue ball, but the actual object is a yellow ball, or a blue cube).

#### target_2.id : string

The `objectId` of the second target object to which the first target object must be transferred.

#### target_2.image : list of lists of lists of integers

An image of the second target object to which the first target object must be transferred, given as a three-dimensional RGB pixel array.

#### target_2.info : list of strings

Human-readable information describing the target object needed for the visualization interface.

#### target_2.match_image : string

Whether the image of the second target object (`target_2.image`) exactly matches the actual object in the scene. If `false`, then the actual second target object will be different in one way (for example, the image may depict a blue ball, but the actual object is a yellow ball, or a blue cube).

### Traversal

In a scenario that has a traversal goal, you must find and move next to a target object. This may involve exploring the scene, and avoiding obstacles. These scenarios will demand a "common sense" understanding of self navigation (how to move and rotate yourself within a scene and around obstacles).

A retrieval goal's `metadata` (with `category` of `"TRAVERSAL"`) will also have the following properties:

#### target.id : string

The `objectId` of the target object to find and move next to.

#### target.image : list of lists of lists of integers

An image of the target object to find and move next to, given as a three-dimensional RGB pixel array.

#### target.info : list of strings

Human-readable information describing the target object needed for the visualization interface.

#### target.match_image : string

Whether the image of the target object (`target.image`) exactly matches the actual target object in the scene. If `false`, then the actual object will be different in one way (for example, the image may depict a blue ball, but the actual object is a yellow ball, or a blue cube).

## Config File

To use an MCS configuration file, set the `MCS_CONFIG_FILE_PATH` environment variable to the path of your MCS configuration file.

### Config File Properties

#### metadata

The `metadata` property describes what metadata will be returned by the MCS Python library. The `metadata` property is available so that users can run baseline or ablation studies during training. It can be set to one of the following strings:

- `full`: Returns the metadata for all the objects in the scene, including visible, held, and hidden objects.
- `no_navigation`: Does not return the position or rotation of the player or the objects in the scene.
- `no_vision`: Does not return the depth or object masks, camera properties, or object dimensions, directions, or distances.
- `none`: Only returns the images (but not the masks), object IDs, and properties corresponding to the player themself (like head tilt or pose) and haptic feedback (like mass or materials of held objects).

Otherwise, return the metadata for the visible and held objects.

### Using the Config File to Generate Scene Graphs or Maps

1. Save your MCS configuration file with `metadata: full`

2. Create a simple Python script to loop over one or more JSON scene configuration files, load each scene in the MCS controller, and save the output data in your own scene graph or scene map format.

```python
import os
from machine_common_sense.mcs import MCS

os.environ['MCS_CONFIG_FILE_PATH'] = # Path to your MCS configuration file

scene_files = # List of scene configuration file paths

unity_app = # Path to your MCS Unity application

controller = MCS.create_controller(unity_app)

for scene_file in scene_files:
    config_data, status = MCS.load_config_json(scene_file)

    if status is not None:
        print(status)
    else:
        output = controller.start_scene(config_data)
        # Use the output to save your scene graph or map
```
