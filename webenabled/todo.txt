ToDo
--------
make it say 'loading' or something so you can see that a new
   scene is being read in.

make it respond immediately on browsing to page, rather than
   waiting for unity to start up.  

timeout session and close unity controller

figure out timing of step->image, one behind???

count # users and don't go above a certain number
   -- figure out max number on g4dn

show step number, show when scene over, habituation, etc.

show list of actions taken

======================

Done
-----
do sessions / user managment properly!

load scene file when clicked (not hard coded)

list actions available as a fn of scene

log correctly
