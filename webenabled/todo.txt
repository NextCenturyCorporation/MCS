ToDo
--------
make it say 'loading' or something so you can see that a new
   scene is being read in.

make it respond immediately on browsing to page, rather than
   waiting for unity to start up.  Some sort of async/await
   or maybe use Quark

timeout session and close unity controller

figure out timing of step->image, one behind???

count # users and don't go above a certain number
   -- figure out max number on g4dn

show step number, show when scene over, habituation, etc.

show list of actions taken

======================

Done
-----
do sessions / user managment properly!

load scene file when clicked (not hard coded)

list actions available as a fn of scene

log correctly
